          <p>
            Hello! My name is Mohiul and I enjoy creating things that live on
            the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012
            when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out
            hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML &
            CSS!
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an
            advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
            student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
            accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
            Upstatement for a variety of clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to
            build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.
          </p>
          <p>Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:</p>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
              <li>React</li>
              <li>Node.js</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>TypeScript</li>
              <li>Eleventy</li>
              <li>WordPress</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <Avater />
      </StyledAboutMe>
    );
  }
}
export default AboutMe;
