        <h2>Build a Spotify Connected App</h2>
        <p>
          Having struggled with understanding how the Spotify OAuth flow works,
          I made the course I wish I could have had. Unlike tutorials that only
          cover a few concepts and leave you with half-baked GitHub
          repositories, this course covers everything from explaining the
          principles of REST APIs to implementing Spotify's OAuth flow and
          fetching API data in a React app. By the end of the course, youâ€™ll
          have an app deployed to the internet you can add to your portfolio.
